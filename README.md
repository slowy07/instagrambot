#### Running Instagrambot

To run InstaPy, you'll need to run the **[quickstart](https://github.com/instagrambot/instagrambot-quickstart)** script you've just downloaded.

- [Here is the easiest **quickstart** script you can use](https://github.com/instagrambot/instagrambot-quickstart/blob/master/quickstart.py)  

You can put in your account details now by passing the username and password parameters to the `instagrambot()` function in your **quickstart** script, like so: 
```python
InstaPy(username="abcd", 
        password="1234")
```
Or you can [pass them using the Command Line Interface (CLI)](./DOCUMENTATION.md#pass-arguments-by-cli).

> If you've used _instagrambot_ before installing it by **pip**, you have to move your _old_ data to the new **workspace** folder for on
[Read how to do this here](./DOCUMENTATION.md#migrating-your-data-to-the-workspace-folder).

Once you have your **quickstart** script configured you can execute the script with the following commands.

```elm
python quickstart.py
-- or
python quickstart.py --username abcd --password 1234
```

Instagrambot will now open a browser window and start working.

> If want instagrambot to run in the background pass the `--headless-browser` option when running from the CLI   
Or add the `headless_browser=True` parameter to the `Instagrambot(headless_browser=True)` constructor.

#### Updating instagrambot
